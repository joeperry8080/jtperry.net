        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
            I am a tech enthusiast community college professor preparing students for careers in IT. 
                I have nearly 20 years of professional experience, both in corporate IT and as an educator. 
                I hold multiple certifications from CompTIA and am always keeping my skills updated.
        </p>

        <h2>What is this website?</h2>
        <p>
            I decided to build this site as a personal project for one of the courses I teach, and am dedicating it to my students. 
                The resoruces I plan to add to this site are from common questions that I receive from students every term. Think of it as a way to 
                catalog the information so that it is easy to find. 
            <br><br>
            This site is a work in progress, I will be adding more resoruces and information on an ongoing basis.
        </p>
